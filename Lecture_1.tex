\slide[What is a Differential Equation?]{\vspace{-.5em}
A differential equation (DE) is an equation involving an unknown function $y$ and atleast one derivative of $y$ w.r.t. one or more independent variables.

\item [Given:]  A DE with an unknown function $y(t)$. \hfill  \student{e.x., $\carray{\dd{y}{t} = - 3 y(t) \\ \text{\uline{or}} \\ \\y\p = -3y}$}
\item[Task:]  Find the function(s) $y(t)$.\hfill  \student{Solution: $y(t)=C_1e^{-3t}$}

\item[Tools:]
\itmz{\item Calculus (i.e., integration/differentiation) \item Geuss and check (does some function $f(t)$ make LHS=RHS?) \item Specialized procedures (informed by experience geussing) \item Geometry/Linear Algebra (useful for systems of DEs)}

\item Linear DEs
\student{\subitem{Linear combination of the function and its derivatives. \item Linear: $c_1+c_2y+c_3y\p +c_4y\pp=0$  \item Nonlinear: $c_1(y)^2+c_2yy\p +c_3(y\pp)^3=0$}}\vfill
\item Order of a DE
\student{\subitem{Pick out the highest derivative of $y(x$) in the DE. 
\item If $n$ is the number of derivatives, then the order of the ODE is also $n$.

\item Solution of a differential equation\vfill
\student{\subitem{Any function that satisfies the eq (i.e., makes LHS=RHS) for \uline{all} values of the independent variable(s). \vfill
\item This seems very silly, but when in doubt it is the most useful thing to remember.}

\subsection{Seperable equations}
\slide[This is not a differential eqaution]{\vspace{-.5em}
Suppose\[\dd{y}{t} = t^2\]
Find $y(t)$
\student{
Multiply both sides by $dt$
\algn{
\dd{y}{t}dt&=t^2 dt\intertext{Integrate}
\int dy &=\int t^2 dt\\
y(t) + C_1 &= \frac{t^3}{3} + C_2\\
y(t)  &= \frac{t^3}{3} + C
}}
\vfill
Since $y(t)$ does not appear in the equation \hfill - \hfill not a differential equation.

}

\slide[A first order linear ODE]{\vspace{-.5em}
Suppose\[\dd{y}{t} = t^2 y(t) \]
Find $y(t)$
\student{
Divide by $y$, then mulitply dt
\algn{
\frac{dy}{\cancel{dt}} \frac{1}y{} \cancel{dt}  &=t^2 dt\intertext{integrate}
\int \frac{dy}{y} &=\int t^2 dt\\
\ln(y) &= \frac{t^3}{3} + C\intertext{exponentiate both sides}
y(t)  &= e^{\frac{t^3}{3} + C}=Ce^{\frac{t^3}{3}}
}}
}

\slide[A first order nonlinear ODE]{\vspace{-.5em}
Suppose\[\dd{y}{t} = \cos(3t)  y^2 \]
Find $y(t)$
\student{\algn{
\frac{dy}{\cancel{dt}} \frac{1}{y^2}\cancel{ dt} &= \cos(3t) dt\\
\int \frac{dy}{y^2} &=\int \cos(3t) dt\\
\frac{-1}{y} &= \frac{\sin(3t)}{3} + C_1\\\\
y(t)  &= \dfrac{-1}{\frac{\sin(3t)}{3}+C_1} = \dfrac{-3}{\sin(3t)+C}
}}
}

\slide[The generic separable first order ODE]{\vspace{-.5em}
Suppose \[\dd{y}{t} = f(t) g(y)\]
the dependence on $t$ and $y$ can be divided up into two factors multiplying each other. The functions $f$ and $g$ are known.
\vfill
\student{\algn{
\frac{dy}{\cancel{dt}}\frac{1} {g(y)}\cancel{ dt} &=f(t) dt\\
\int \frac{dy}{g(y)} &=\int f(t) dt\\
\Gamma(y) &=F(t) + C\\\\
y(t) &= \Gamma^{-1} \paren{F(t) + C}
}\vfill
Works as long as $1/g(y)$ and $f(t)$ are integrable functions.
